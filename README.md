# Deep-Learning-Models-for-plant-disease-detection
Analyze and compare the convolution neural network models like VGG architecture (built from scratch), VGG architecture (using pre-trained weights), GoogLeNet, AlexNet to detect the of tomato plant diseases using leaves images. Image preprocessing is used to convert and resize the input dataset.
